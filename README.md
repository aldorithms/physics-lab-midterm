## Procedure to measure distance and time.
Distance should be measured using the tape measure already posted on the track, by subtracting the end point from the starting point. The time should ideally be measured with the pulse monitor, and if not applicable, should be measured using a stopwatch. To account for human error, two stop watches could be used simultaneously.
## Procedure to determine the uncertainty in the distance and time.
Uncertainty may be determined by establishing a range of values that both variables could have been, such as having multiple stopwatch values.
## How to utilize the graphical method:
### What is graphed on the y-axis.
The distance is graphed on the y-axis
### What is graphed on the x-axis.
The time is graphed on the x-axis
### How to use this graph to determine acceleration.
The graph can be used to determine acceleration by fitting an equation to it, and then finding its derivative.
## Result Analysis: One way to assess success
One way to assess success is through comparing it with it's predicted value.
